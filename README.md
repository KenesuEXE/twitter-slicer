### How to Use?

1. Paste your text onto `texthere.txt`.
2. Run `main.py`.
3. Pick slicing modes in the command-line.
4. All done! Go copy the text and tweet!

### Slicing Modes

**By Limit**  
Slice the text into strictly 280-character chunks to maximize the character limit.

**By Space**  
Slice the text in whitespaces so it doesn't cut between words.

**By Punctuation**  
Slice the text in punctuation marks so it doesn't cut between sentences.

**Add Counter**  
Adds a counter at the end of the tweet to keep it numbered.

### What Each Files Do
`main.py` Main script, run this.  
`texthere.txt` Paste your text to be sliced HERE.   
`twitterslicer.py` All logic and functions here.  
`keys.py` Paste tokens here if you want to directly post to Twitter.
