# TWITTER SLICER 

*Slice your lengthy texts into tweetable chunks!*

### How to Use?

1. Paste your text onto `texthere.txt`.
2. Run `main.py`.
3. Pick slicing modes in the command-line.
4. All done! Go copy the text and tweet!

### Slicing Modes

**By Limit**  
Slice the text into strictly 280-character chunks to maximize the character limit.

**By Space**  
Slice the text in whitespaces so it doesn't cut between words.

**By Punctuation**  
Slice the text in punctuation marks so it doesn't cut between sentences.

**Add Counter**  
Adds a counter at the end of the tweet to keep it numbered.
