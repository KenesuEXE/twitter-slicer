# TWITTER SLICER 
Slice your lengthy texts into tweetable chunks!

#### Slicing Modes

**By Limit**
Cut the text into strictly 280-character chunks to maximize every tweet.

**By Space**
Cut the text in whitespaces so it doesn't cut between words.

**By Punctuation**
Cut the text in punctuation marks so it doesn't cut between sentences.

**Add Counter**
Adds a counter at the end of the tweet to keep it numbered.
